## SST-Prediction-XGBoost

This is a Jupyter Notebook that uses [XGBoost](https://pypi.org/project/xgboost/) Machine Learning (ML) techniques for time series prediction of sea surface temperature (SST).  The input data is from the [National Data Buoy Center (NDBC)](https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/) buoys located along the Northern Outer Banks of North Carolina for NDBC stations 44056, 44100, and 44086 located in Duck (44056 and 44100) and Nags Head (44086).  You can modify the station location to your preference, but you will need to modify the years over which you are working with since this can vary between locations.
